# Hi, I'm João Scarpa 👋

I'm a passionate and purpose-driven Software Engineer with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, an MBA in IT Management, and a specialization in Higher Education Teaching.

Since 2013, I’ve been building impactful digital products—primarily with **Ruby on Rails**—with a strong focus on scalable backend architecture and Agile methodologies. My career spans startups, fintechs, and global teams, where I balance hands-on engineering with mentoring, technical leadership, and continuous process improvement.

## 👨‍🏫 Teaching & Mentorship

One of the most rewarding aspects of my journey is teaching others to code. I’m deeply committed to knowledge sharing and supporting others’ growth, whether through mentorship, workshops, or structured onboarding initiatives.

## 🚀 What Drives Me

- Solving real problems with clean, maintainable code
- Continuous learning and self-improvement
- Helping people thrive in tech
